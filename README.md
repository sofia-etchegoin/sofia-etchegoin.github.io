# sofia-etchegoin.github.io/welcome

This webpage was initially built with vanilla HTML and CSS for my Dev Academy course.

I re-wrote the code after the course finished, freshly equipped with React skills. My goal was to create a minimalistic website with cleanly-written code, breaking down the page sections into components using new React hooks to create responsive front-end features.

To run the website in development:

Clone the repo and run

```sh
npm install
```

to install dependencies, and

```sh
npm start
```

to view in http://localhost:3000/.
