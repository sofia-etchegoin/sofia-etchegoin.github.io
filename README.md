This blog page was initially simply built with vanilla HTML and CSS for my Dev Academy course.

I re-wrote the code after the course finished, freshly equipped with the React knowledge that came out of it. I decided to make a front-end only, minimalistic blogpage, with cleanly-written code breaking down the page sections into components and creating responsive front-end features.
