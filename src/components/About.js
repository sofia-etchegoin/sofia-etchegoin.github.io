      <p>
        A public servant and software developer, I'm a career-changer on the
        lookout for the next opportunity in Wellington.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tech aligns with my skills and interest in project coordination,
        collaborative problem-solving, and continual learning. In pursuit of a
        challenge, I started teaching myself how to code last year and haven’t
        looked back.

      <p>
        Completing the bootcamp at Dev Academy Aotearoa further ignited a love
        for working with others to create well-designed applications. Creating
        technical solutions to help others and writing clean code excite me, and
        I’m looking forward to learning more.
