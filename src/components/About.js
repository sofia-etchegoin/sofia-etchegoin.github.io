      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I have five years of public-sector experience in Wellington and one year
        of English teaching experience in Madrid. I transitioned into tech
        because it aligns with my skills and interest in project coordination,
        collaborative problem-solving, and continual learning. In pursuit of a
        challenge, I started teaching myself how to code last year and haven’t
        looked back. Completing the bootcamp at Dev Academy Aotearoa further
        ignited a love for working with others to create well-designed
        applications. Building great software to help others excites me, and I’m
        looking forward to learning more.
