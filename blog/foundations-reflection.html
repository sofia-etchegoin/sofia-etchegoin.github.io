      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
      <p>That...</p>
      <p><ol>
        <li>I need to work on slowing down my thought process when I’m stuck on something.</li>
        <li>If I lean into a difficult problem with curiosity instead of trepidation, it makes the problem solving whole process so much easier!</li>
        <li>I’m a pretty independent learner, but definitely could be better at reaching out for help.</li>
      </ol></p>

      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <br><p>I think they are central to learning how to programme. Those are the tools you fall back on when solving difficult problems with others.</p>
      <br><h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <br><p>I have been surprised by the amount of emphasis on the core soft skills in this course. Naturally, when you sign up to a software development bootcamp it’s easy to assume that’s the only thing you will focus on. But it’s great to focus on soft skills as we move into the tech industry. It’s also useful when thinking about the sorts of workplaces we want to work for, because if employers are interested in how emotionally intelligent their employees are, then that will likely yield good outcomes for them too.</p>
      <br><h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <br><p>Sharing those core blog posts with people who I haven’t met in person yet. I’m a very private person, so it feels a bit exposing to put those reflections out in the ether!</p>
      <br><h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
     <br><p>Because those skills are always going to be essential to work effectively with others. There is a stereotype that developers aren’t very people-oriented and I think it’s important to be aware of that.</p>
      <br><h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <br><p>I think the majority of the core content has been helpful. There were a few Core questions in the blogs that felt a bit repetitive, but otherwise it’s been good to mentally prepare for Bootcamp with those reflections.</p>
