    <p><h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3></p>
    <br><p>The short answer is: I'm not sure! I’m open to ideas. Generally speaking, I fancy a challenge and doing something that keeps me on my toes. Becoming a globe-trotting freelancer appeals, but let’s see.</p>
    
    <br><p><h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3></p>
    <br><p>My strength is that I am a checklist enthusiast. I thrive on setting objectives and delight in that satisfying "done" tick.</p>
    <br><p>A limitation is that I sometimes dive headfirst into the ocean of details, even when I'm just trying to paddle in the shallow end. It’ll be necessary to remind myself of the “it’s good enough” ethos for the rest of the course.</p>

    <br><br><p><h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3></p>
    <br><p>I would love to work on better-facilitating difficult conversations. Navigating and deciphering the cryptic riddles of miscommunication or disagreements — those are the real feats. Those moments can be easy to ignore or walk away from, but sometimes you need to lean into them to make sure everyone is on the same page.</p>

    <br><br><p><h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3></p>
    <br><p>The blueprint is simple: self-care reigns supreme. Prioritising the holy trinity of sleep, exercise, and quality time with loved ones is key. And when the stress-o-meter starts to beep, that's a cue to go outside and look at a lovely tree, ya know?
    </p>

    <br><br><p><h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3></p>
    <br><p>I've got a "three strikes, you're in" rule. If I can't crack a problem with three different approaches, it's time to deploy the bat-signal for help.</p>

    <br><br><p><h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3></p>
    <br><p>I'm hoping for a dynamic duo of support, much like the supportive relationship between Batman and Alfred. They won't be serving up all the answers on a silver platter; instead, they'll be our trusty sidekicks, challenging our brains to work up a sweat. We'll be out there problem-solving, and they'll be our Alfred, offering wisdom from the shadows.</p>

    <br><br><p><h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3></p>
    <br><p>I have to block out a daily commitment to exercise. If the body feels good, then the mind does too! </p>
