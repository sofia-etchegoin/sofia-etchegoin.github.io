      <h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <br><p>I wasn’t sure how to answer this during Sprint 2, but on reflection I think I want to work in the private sector initially. I’d love to join a company that has a great work culture and supports the development of their employees. Long-term, after gaining some experience and if I end up specialising in something I might try to work for myself. Generally speaking, I would love to be able to effectively problem-solve collaboratively by the end of the course. The goal is to be the sort of team member who positively contributes to a healthy work culture and is able to solve complex problems.</p>
      
      <br><h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <br><p>Biggest strength - much the same as what I said in Sprint 2 below; perseverance and time-management.</p>
      <br><p>Biggest weakness - not reaching out for help when I need it. I’ve noticed it more during Foundations because it’s easy to fly under the radar when you’re studying remotely. But if I don’t address that habit during Bootcamp, it might hinder my development and ability to contribute to group projects.</p>
      <br><h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <br><p>Definitely maintaining some sort of balance outside of Bootcamp. Making sure I’m exercising enough, sleeping well, eating well - those things take time and I hope I don’t feel stressed in stepping away from studying every now and then to take care of myself.</p>
      <br><h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <br><p>Practising giving and receiving feedback and developing leadership skills would be great. I struggle to not feel embarrassed during difficult conversations and saying it how it is. I’m also very independent and not inclined to take up leadership roles, but maybe this could be an area for growth if I’m any good at it.</p>
      <br><h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <br><p>Exactly the same as the Sprint 2 answer below. But just to add that I would expect the same level of support for the personal development aspects of the course alongside the technical parts.</p>
      <br><h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
      <br><p>Again, much like what I said in Sprint 2 my expectations of myself include committing to self-care but also to seeking help if I need it. To manage the workload, I will also commit to setting clear boundaries with commitments outside of study. That way, I’ll be in a good headspace to keep up with the course.</p>

    <p><h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3></p>
    <br><p>The short answer is: I'm not sure! I’m open to ideas. Generally speaking, I fancy a challenge and doing something that keeps me on my toes. Becoming a globe-trotting freelancer appeals, but let’s see.</p>
    
    <br><p><h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3></p>
    <br><p>My strength is that I am a checklist enthusiast. I thrive on setting objectives and delight in that satisfying "done" tick.</p>
    <br><p>A limitation is that I sometimes dive headfirst into the ocean of details, even when I'm just trying to paddle in the shallow end. It’ll be necessary to remind myself of the “it’s good enough” ethos for the rest of the course.</p>

    <br><br><p><h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3></p>
    <br><p>I would love to work on better-facilitating difficult conversations. Navigating and deciphering the cryptic riddles of miscommunication or disagreements — those are the real feats. Those moments can be easy to ignore or walk away from, but sometimes you need to lean into them to make sure everyone is on the same page.</p>

    <br><br><p><h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3></p>
    <br><p>The blueprint is simple: self-care reigns supreme. Prioritising the holy trinity of sleep, exercise, and quality time with loved ones is key. And when the stress-o-meter starts to beep, that's a cue to go outside and look at a lovely tree, ya know?
    </p>

    <br><br><p><h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3></p>
    <br><p>I've got a "three strikes, you're in" rule. If I can't crack a problem with three different approaches, it's time to deploy the bat-signal for help.</p>

    <br><br><p><h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3></p>
    <br><p>I'm hoping for a dynamic duo of support, much like the supportive relationship between Batman and Alfred. They won't be serving up all the answers on a silver platter; instead, they'll be our trusty sidekicks, challenging our brains to work up a sweat. We'll be out there problem-solving, and they'll be our Alfred, offering wisdom from the shadows.</p>

    <br><br><p><h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3></p>
    <br><p>I have to block out a daily commitment to exercise. If the body feels good, then the mind does too! </p>
