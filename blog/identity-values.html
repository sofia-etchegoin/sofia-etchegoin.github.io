      <p><h3>When have you had to make an ethical decision?</h3></p>
      <br><p>I guess when pondering the moral dilemma of where to buy food from. We have a Wonky Box subscription and order our meat, eggs and milk from a farm in Eketahuna. Hopefully it helps with fighting the food-waste-minimisation fight and supporting local farmers.</p>
      <br><br><p><h3>How your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3></p>
      <br><p>My parents have had a good deal of influence on my values. My mother comes from a family of business-owners. They're all about forging their own paths, crafting their destinies with a DIY spirit. My father on the other hand comes from an academic family. They've dedicated themselves to the pursuit of education; serving the intellectual realm through universities, schools, and public institutions. The common trait is that both sides of the family have an unwavering commitment to hard work. I think that has shaped my values and identity, although I really appreciate those folks who remind me to have a break too!</p>
      <br><p><h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3></p>
      <br><p>Allow me to introduce you to my superpower: I am the Taskmaster! I love a list, setting goals and methodically checking them off. Surely that’ll help steer the learning ship through those choppy Javascript waters in the distance?
      </p>
      <br><br><p><h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3></p>
      <br><p>Gather around folks, because I'm about to reveal my Achilles' heel. You see, I have this tiny tendency to become a bit too... focused. Let's call it "enthusiastically immersed." When I set my sights on a goal, I tend to charge full steam ahead, kind of like a bull in a china shop.</p>
      <br><p>This can be effective when I'm on the right track, but sometimes I can end up in Wonderland chasing a white rabbit without realising it.</p>
      <br><p>But I'm actively working on my "pause and reflect" game. I'm learning to take breaks when I'm just on the edge of enthusiasm overload. Plus, I'm trying to embrace the art of sharing my journey with others and seeking their wisdom.</p>
      <br><br><p><h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3></p>
      <br><p>This is a recent example of 'working productively' with family, rather than with colleagues in a workplace, but I think it serves the question nicely.</p> 
        <br><p>Picture this, a cluttered house, several items of unused furniture, a family that doesn’t have the time to sort it out, and me, the ultimate minimalist. (For context, I can basically fit all my stuff in a carry-on suitcase. Except for my bikes of course.) My grand plan? Price everything at a cool $1 on Trademe and let the bidding frenzy begin. That’ll surely get rid of the furniture quickly and help the family out?</p>
        <br><p>Here's where the tension kicks in. Turns out, they had some rather different valuations in mind for their beloved pieces. Fair enough.</p> 
        <br><p>To smooth things over, I took the democratic route. I gathered their feedback, revised the prices accordingly, and tried to strike a balance between their expectations and my need for a swift sale.</p>
        <br><p>In hindsight, my eagerness to declutter and espouse my minimalism needed tempering from the beginning. It would have been wiser to ensure sure everyone was on the same page before diving into the task. Takeaway lesson: Communication is key.</p>
