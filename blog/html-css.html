    <div>
      <h3>In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), relative, absolute, and fixed positioning are three different ways to control the layout and positioning of elements on a webpage.</h3>
    </div>

      <div> 
      <h2>Relative Positioning</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
        <li>This is the default positioning behaviour for HTML elements.</li>
        <li>It is positioned <span class="italic">relative</span> to its normal position in the document flow.</li>
        <li>You use "top", "right", "bottom" and "left" to offset the element relative to its original position.</li>
        <li>Other elements in the document flow are not affected by the element's relative positioning. It essentially creates a new positioning context for the element without affecting the surrounding elements.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </div> 
    
   <div>    
   <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
     <p>
       <ul>
       <li>When an element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor element</li>
       <li>If no ancestor element has a position other than the default "static," the element will be positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is typically the viewport.</li>
       <li>Takes the element out of the normal document flow, so it won't affect the layout of other elements. Other elements will ignore the space previously occupied by the absolutely positioned element.</li>
       </ul>
     </p>   
  </div> 
        
  <div>
  <h2>Fixed Positioning</h2>
   <p>
     <ul>
     <li>Is similar to absolute positioning, but it positions the element relative to the viewport, regardless of scrolling.</li>
     <li>A fixed-positioned element will stay in the same position on the screen even when the user scrolls the page.</li>
     <li>Like absolute positioning, it takes the element out of the normal document flow.</li>
     </ul>
    </p>   
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>In summary, relative positioning positions an element relative to its normal position, absolute positioning positions it relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, and fixed positioning positions it relative to the viewport.</p>
