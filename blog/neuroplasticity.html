    <div class="blog-text">
    <p><h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3></p>
    <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can help people:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Embrace lifelong learning and personal growth.</li>
      <br><li>Recover from brain injuries.</li>
      <br><li>Break harmful habits and form positive ones.</li>
      <br><li>Improve their mental wellbeing.</li>
    </ol>
    <br><h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
    </h3>
    <p>Through practise, practise, practise! Gotta fire off the JavaScript neural pathways many times to nail that lingo!
    </p>
    <br><h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>I find that trying to explain what I’ve learnt is a great way of increasing my neuroplasticity. Especially if I happen to find a non-technical person who is good enough to not run away from techy conversation, it’s a good way of finding any gaps in my understanding. Likewise, if I put new information into different contexts, I’m bound to reinforce my understanding of it and therefore increase my neuroplasticity.
    </p>
    <br><h3>A resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
    <p>You know what, ChatGPT is my go-to. If there’s a concept that I’m struggling to get my head around, I’ll interrogate chatGPT with a line of questioning until I understand it. It’s a great way of drilling new information without feeling like you’re wasting someone else’s time.
    </p>
    <br><h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <br><h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
    <p>A growth mindset is the belief system or attitude that capabilities can be developed over time through effort, learning and persistence. It’s relevant because it challenges the notion that intelligence or ability are static traits. Anyone can improve their abilities over time, and it’s empowering for people to know that.</p>
    <br><h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    <p>Nope! But it never hurts to reflect on these ideas every so often. It’s easy to forget about a growth mindset and the benefits of neuroplasticity when you’re in the middle of learning something difficult, hey.</p>
    <br><h3>How will you integrate ‘growth mindset’ into your learning journey?</h3>
    <p>By doing exactly that, I guess! Integrate that self-awareness of having a ‘growth mindset’ as part of completing the rest of this course.</p>
    <br><h3>A link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
    <p>This video on <span style="color: pink"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWn_TJTrnU&ab_channel=Sprouts" target="_blank">Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset</a></span> is pretty neat.</p>
    <br><h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
    <p>I reckon within my Taskmaster approach to everything, I can create a bit more space for seeking feedback and appreciating moments of failure. For example, if a tricky concept doesn’t quite stick, or I don’t know how to solve something straight away, I usually don’t even acknowledge it. I just carry on with something else that I can do and hope that I subconsciously figure out the problem before coming back to it. I think it’ll be good for me to reach out for help when those difficulties arise, especially during Bootcamp!</p>
