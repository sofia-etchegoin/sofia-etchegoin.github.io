      <h3>Tell us about a time you were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have many small blocks on simple problems all the time. The usual
        scenario is trying to remember the exact syntax for the different JS
        methods or functions (for loops, if/else statements etc.) Where do I put
        the brackets? How do I structure the arguments? Marrying up the problem
        with the JS solution can be tricky to figure out. But using pseudocode
        really helps with fleshing out the approach. The key takeaway is that
        it’s ok if you can’t write perfectly correct code on the first go,
        there’s a drafting process involved!
      </p>

      <h3>Have you elegantly solved a problem?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Pffftt. Can’t say I’ve elegantly solved any problems yet LOL. It’s more
        ‘organised chaos’ at this stage. The process involves finding any
        solution that loosely works and then revising the code afterwards. It
        can feel like falling into different rabbit holes and climbing back out
        to try other approaches, but it’s a creative process and not necessarily
        linear. Especially when trying to grapple with a new concept and execute
        it within the context of a problem. I look forward to the day when I can
        reflect on a solution and say, 'damn, that was elegant'!
      </p>

      <h3>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques: <br></nr><br />Pseudocode | Trying something | Rubber ducky method |
        Reading error messages | Console.logging | Googling | Asking peers and
        coaches for help | Improving your process with reflection
      </h3>
      <br><p>
        I’m pretty confident with all of those techniques, except asking peers
        or coaches for help! Which segues nicely to the next question…
      </p>
      <h3>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h3>
      <br><p>All the time, frankly! I like trying to solve things by myself, and it’s easy to go solo during Foundations. Generally speaking, I much prefer having a face-to-face chat if I reach out for help. My perceived barrier is in using online platforms to reach out to others, it’s not something that I normally engage with. Moving forward though, it’ll be important to reach out virtually if working remotely with others. Just got to do it!
