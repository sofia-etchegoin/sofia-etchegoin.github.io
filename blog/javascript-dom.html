      <p><h3>What's an analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS?</h3></p>
      <br><p>Think of HTML, CSS and Javascript as a dynamic trio. HTML contains the structure and content of a page, CSS is the misunderstood <i>artiste</i> who makes the HTML content look pretty, and JavaScript is the wizard that brings everything to life on the page (like interactivity and effects). </p>

      <br><p><h3>What are 'control flow' and 'loops'?</h3></p>
      <br><p>Let’s use the cute example of gardening to illustrate this.</p>
      <br><p><b>Control flow:</b> refers to the order in which actions or steps are executed in a process. In gardening, this could be making decisions about the order of jobs to carry out throughout the year.</p>
      <br><p><b>Loops:</b> are repetitive actions or steps performed until a specific condition is met. In this case, loops will be the maintenance tasks for ongoing garden care.</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li><b>Planning the garden (control flow):</b> You need to decide what to grow and location for planting.</li>
        <li><b>Preparing the soil (control flow):</b> After planning, you prepare the soil (shout out to Charles Dowding’s ‘no dig’ methods - if you aren’t already a fan of his YouTube content, prepare yourself for a wholesome dive into the world of ‘no dig’).</li>
        <li><b>Planting seeds (control flow):</b> You plant seeds or seedlings according to your garden plan.</li>
        <li><b>Watering (control flow):</b> You decide how much watering is required depending on the specific crops and weather conditions.</li>
        <li><b>Ongoing watering (loops):</b> Watering is an ongoing task that occurs in loops. This process is repeated depending on whether certain soil moisture ‘conditions’ are met.</li>
        <li><b>Weeding (control flow):</b> Once again, this is where Charles Dowding’s golden advice swoops in and you decide to cover weeds with cardboard or tarp to manage the majority of them.</li>
        <li><b>Ongoing weeding (loops):</b> You periodically inspect whether the odd weed pops through, and you can remove them as they appear.</li>
        <li><b>Fertilising (control flow):</b> You decide whether to use fertilisers or not, and apply them as needed.</li>
        <li><b>Ongoing care (loops):</b> You regularly prune, fertilise, monitor for pests and diseases entering loops for each of these repetitive tasks.</li>
        <li><b>Harvesting (control flow):</b> When the plants are ready, you harvest the fruit and vegetables.</li>
        <li><b>End of season clear up and plan for the next season (control flow):</b> You clear any produce from the garden and prepare it for the next season.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><h3>What is the DOM?</h3></p>
      <br><p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is not a physical or visible part of a web page; rather, it's a programming interface provided by web browsers that represents the structure and content of a web page as a hierarchical tree-like structure. At the top of the DOM tree is a single object called the "document" object. This represents the entire web page. From there, the tree branches out to include elements and their child elements, forming a hierarchy.</p>
      <br><p>The DOM is created by the browser when it loads a web page, and it exists in memory as an abstract representation of the page's structure and content. When you press F12 or use your browser's developer tools to inspect a web page, what you're seeing is an interface that allows you to interact with and inspect the Document Object Model (DOM) of that web page. So, in a way, you are viewing the DOM, but it's presented to you in a more user-friendly and interactive format.</p>
      <br><p>Here's an analogy to illustrate the DOM:</p>
      <br><p>Think of a web page as a book with different chapters and pages. The DOM is like an index or table of contents for that book, providing a structured way to access and modify each chapter or page.</p>
      <br><p>Example of interacting with the DOM</p>
      <br><p>Let's say you have a web page with a button on it, and you want to change the text displayed on that button when a user clicks it. Here's how you might interact with the DOM in JavaScript to achieve this:</p>
      <br><img src="https://github.com/sofia-etchegoin/sofia-etchegoin.github.io/blob/main/blog/DOM-code-img.png?raw=true" alt="Doh! This is supposed to illustrate interacting with the DOM.">
      <br><ol>
        <br><li>There is a button with the id 'myButton'.</li>
        <br><li>In the "script" element, you use the JavaScript code <span style="color: pink">'document.getElementById('myButton')'</span> to access and store a reference to this button element in the DOM.</li>
        <br><li>We add an event listener to the button to listen for the 'click' event.</li>
        <br><li>When the button is clicked, the event listener function is triggered and it changes the button's text using <span style="color:pink">'button.text.Content'</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p><h3>What's the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects?</h3></p>
      <br><p>Arrays are like a line of people holding hands, and objects are like a set of drawers with labelled handles.</p>
      <br><p><b>Arrays:</b> Imagine a line of people standing in a row, each person holding the hand of the person next to them. To reach a specific person in the line, you count from the beginning or end of the line to find the person you're looking for. For example, if you want to find the 5th person, you count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and then you're there. In arrays, data is accessed by position or index, much like finding a person in a human chain.</p>
      <br><p><b>Objects:</b> Imagine a pantry with various containers, each labelled with a different category like "Cereals," "Spices," or "Snacks." Inside each container, you have items related to that category. To find a particular item, you don't need to know its position; you simply look for the container with the right label, open it, and grab what you need. In objects, data is organised by labels or keys, much like how items in a pantry are sorted into labelled containers.</p>
      <br><p>Depending on your needs, you might choose one over the other for organising and accessing your data</p>

      <br><br><p><h3>What are functions and why are they helpful?</h3></p>
      <br><p>Functions are like ‘containers’ to store information or instructions. They are helpful because they make your code organised, reusable and you can ‘call’ functions to perform certain things. Imagine a function like a recipe card:</p>
      <br><ol>
        <li>Every recipe card (function) has a name, and when you say its name (or ‘call the function’), JavaScript gets cooking.</li>
        <li>Think of the ingredients in the recipe card as the ‘parameters’ of the function.</li>
        <li>The recipe instructions are the ‘code’ inside the function. This tells JavaScript what to do with the ingredients to make the recipe.</li>
        <li>You can reuse the recipe card over and over again by calling it. You don’t need to write out the instructions every time.</li>
        <li>After the recipe is made, JavaScript can give you back the meal as a result, or a ‘return’.</li>
      </ol>
