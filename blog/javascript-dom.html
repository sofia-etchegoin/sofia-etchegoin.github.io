      <p><h3>What's an analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS?</h3></p>
      <br><p>Think of HTML, CSS and Javascript as a dynamic trio. HTML contains the structure and content of a page, CSS is the misunderstood <i>artiste</i> who makes the HTML content look pretty, and JavaScript is the wizard that brings everything to life on the page (like interactivity and effects). </p>

      <br><br><p><h3>What are 'control flow' and 'loops'?</h3></p>
      <br><p><b>Control flow:</b> refers to the order in which actions or steps are executed in a process. In gardening, this could be making decisions about the order of jobs to carry out throughout the year.</p>
      <br><p><b>Loops:</b> are repetitive actions or steps performed until a specific condition is met. In this case, loops will be the maintenance tasks for ongoing garden care.</p>
      <br><p>Let’s use the cute example of gardening to illustrate this.</p>
      <br><p><b>Planning the garden (control flow):</b> You need to decide what to grow and location for planting.</p>
      <br><p><b>Preparing the soil (control flow):</b> After planning, you prepare the soil (shout out to Charles Dowding’s ‘no dig’ methods - if you aren’t already a fan of his YouTube content, prepare yourself for a wholesome dive into the world of ‘no dig’).</p>
      <br><p><b>Planting seeds (control flow):</b> You plant seeds or seedlings according to your garden plan.</p>
      <br><p><b>Watering (control flow):</b> You decide how much watering is required depending on the specific crops and weather conditions.</p>
      <br><p><b>Ongoing watering (loops):</b> Watering is an ongoing task that occurs in loops. This process is repeated depending on whether certain soil moisture ‘conditions’ are met.</p>
      <br><p><b>Weeding (control flow):</b> Once again, this is where Charles Dowding’s golden advice swoops in and you decide to cover weeds with cardboard or tarp to manage the majority of them.</p>
      <br><p><b>Ongoing weeding (loops):</b> You periodically inspect whether the odd weed pops through, and you can remove them as they appear.</p>
      <br><p><b>Fertilising (control flow):</b> You decide whether to use fertilisers or not, and apply them as needed.</p>
      <br><p><b>Ongoing care (loops):</b> You regularly prune, fertilise, monitor for pests and diseases entering loops for each of these repetitive tasks.</p>
      <br><p><b>Harvesting (control flow):</b> When the plants are ready, you harvest the fruit and vegetables.</p>
      <br><p><b>End of season clear up and plan for the next season (control flow):</b> You clear any produce from the garden and prepare it for the next season.</p>

      <br><br><p><h3>What is the DOM?</h3></p>
      <br><p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is not a physical or visible part of a web page; rather, it's a programming interface provided by web browsers that represents the structure and content of a web page as a hierarchical tree-like structure. At the top of the DOM tree is a single object called the "document" object. This represents the entire web page. From there, the tree branches out to include elements and their child elements, forming a hierarchy.</p>
      <br><p>The DOM is created by the browser when it loads a web page, and it exists in memory as an abstract representation of the page's structure and content. When you press F12 or use your browser's developer tools to inspect a web page, what you're seeing is an interface that allows you to interact with and inspect the Document Object Model (DOM) of that web page. So, in a way, you are viewing the DOM, but it's presented to you in a more user-friendly and interactive format.</p>
      <br><p>Here's an analogy to illustrate the DOM:</p>
      <br><p>Think of a web page as a book with different chapters and pages. The DOM is like an index or table of contents for that book, providing a structured way to access and modify each chapter or page.</p>
      <br><p>Example of interacting with the DOM</p>
      <br><p>Let's say you have a web page with a button on it, and you want to change the text displayed on that button when a user clicks it. Here's how you might interact with the DOM in JavaScript to achieve this:</p>
